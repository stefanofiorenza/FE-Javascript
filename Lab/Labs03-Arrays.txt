	EASY:
	
		1) Create (by code) an array with all multiple of 5 from 5 to 50.
		Print array content
		
		And then:
		2) Print all elements in Odd position
		3) sum all elements in EVEN position
		4) print reversed array
		5) print only ODD numbers
		6) given an additional input as number -> Verify if is in the array
		
	
	Intermediate:
	
		GIVEN: array of 10 numbers 
			
		1) Statistics
		O: print Max, min, sum, mean
		
		2) remove duplicates:
		
		3) given an additional input as number -> Verify if number is in the array
		
		4) Print Sorted array:
		
		5) Shift elements (Right or Left)
		
	Advanced:
	
	    GIVEN: 2 arrays A, B of 5 numbers 
		
		1) Merge array (all elements from both) removing duplicates:
		
		2) Verify if they contain same elements (in whatever position):

		3) Remove from array A all elements in B if present
		
		4)
